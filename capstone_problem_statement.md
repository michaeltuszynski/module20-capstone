# Research Question

"Can we develop a predictive model to identify elderly individuals at high risk of falls within the next 12 months based on their medical history, medication profiles, and functional assessment data?"

## Expected Data Sources

* Primary dataset: National Health and Aging Trends Study (NHATS) public use dataset
* Supplementary data: Medicare Claims data through the CMS Virtual Research Data Center (VRDC)
* Additional context: CDC's STEADI (Stopping Elderly Accidents, Deaths & Injuries) assessment criteria

## Techniques Expected to Use

### 1. Data Integration and Preprocessing
* Advanced data merging techniques for combining NHATS, Medicare Claims, and STEADI data
* Missing data imputation methods appropriate for medical data
* Feature selection and dimensionality reduction (PCA, LASSO)
* Standardization and encoding of medical variables
* Class imbalance handling techniques (SMOTE/ADASYN)

### 2. Machine Learning Models
* Ensemble Methods:
  * Random Forests for robust prediction and feature importance
  * Gradient Boosting (XGBoost/LightGBM) for performance optimization
  * Model stacking for improved accuracy
* Interpretable Models:
  * Logistic Regression (baseline)
  * Decision Trees for transparent decision paths
  * SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) for model interpretation

### 3. Risk Analysis Techniques
* Feature importance analysis
* Partial dependence plots for understanding variable relationships
* LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations)
* Interaction detection methods
* Time-to-event analysis for fall prediction

### 4. Model Validation
* Stratified cross-validation
* Healthcare-specific metrics (sensitivity, specificity)
* Probability calibration
* Clinical validation procedures

### 5. Visualization and Reporting
* Interactive dashboard development
* Risk factor visualization
* Intervention recommendation systems
* Automated clinical report generation

## Expected Results

* A risk scoring system (0-100) indicating fall probability within the next 12 months
* Identification of key modifiable risk factors specific to each individual
* Dashboard showing which interventions might be most effective based on the individual's risk profile
* Analysis of how risk factors interact with each other to compound fall risk

## Why This Question is Important

Falls among the elderly are a critical public health concern with devastating personal and societal impacts. One in four Americans aged 65+ falls each year, and falls are the leading cause of fatal injuries in older adults. Beyond the immediate trauma, falls often trigger a cascade of declining health and loss of independence. The direct medical costs of falls exceed $50 billion annually in the US alone. Most critically, many falls are preventable with proper intervention, but current assessment methods often identify risk too late. A predictive model would allow social services and healthcare providers to intervene proactively with targeted prevention strategies - from medication adjustments to home modifications to physical therapy. This not only preserves seniors' independence and quality of life but also reduces the burden on families and healthcare systems. By identifying high-risk individuals before a fall occurs, we can shift from reactive treatment to preventive care, potentially saving thousands of lives and billions in healthcare costs.
